# Welcome to the repository of: Castle in the Sky! 
## My first turn-based game for android

This is the Repository I'll use to switch between computers far more easily and work more efficently.

## To do for the next alpha update:

- [ ] finish scriptible object: Items.cs
- [ ] make BattleSystem.cs more refined and start turnbased action

## possible ideas for the list

- Enemy Ai with logic building
- animations and characters for the game
- main menu with level access
- levels and xp after fight get saved
- winning/losing screen after fight
- weapons and their integration in stats
- dialog box and before-after fight dialogs
